# Code Validation

## W3C HTML Validator

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/html-index-validate.jpg"></h2>

- The Gather website landing page passed all tests using the [W3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) Validator tool

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/html-5-warning.jpg"></h2>

- The Gather website log in page showed some errors as the form fields have self closing tags. This is something I will look into avoiding in future projects.

## W3C CSS Validator

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/css-validate.jpg"></h2>

- The Gather website passed all tests using the [W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Validator tool

## JSHINT Javascript Code Quality Tool

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/jshint-script.jpg"></h2>
<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/jshint-jquery.jpg"></h2>

- The Gather website passed all tests using the [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) Validator tool

## Python Validation using Gitpod

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/python-errors.jpg"></h2>

- Errors and warnings highlighted by Gitpod included:
    - Scope_session errors. From looking online, this is not actually an error. I could add code to stop this showing as an error
    - Too general exceptions. See future features.

# A11y Color Contrast Accessibility Checker

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/a11y-colour-contrast-check.jpg"></h2>

- The index page was tested using the [A11y Color Contrast Accessibility Checker](https://color.a11y.com/) and no colour contrast issues were found. The same colour palette is used across the site.

# Wave Webaim Accessibility Checker

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/wave-accessibility-checker.jpg"></h2>

- The index page was tested using the [Wave Webaim](https://wave.webaim.org/) accessibility checker and no serious issues were found. 
- The Errors found refer to the fake URLs I've entered for recipe placeholders. The Colour contrast error refers to hidden labels for the Social Media icons.

# Lighthouse

I used the Lighthouse reports in Google Developer Tools to examine the pages of the website for the following
- Performace
- Accessibility
- Best Practices 
- SEO

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/lighthouse-index-mobile.jpg"></h2>

- Gather website scored well in all areas on mobile except for performance. This could be improved by saving images in next gen formats and eliminating unused Javascript. The JS scripts are present on the base template and used by other pages.

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/lighthouse-index-desktop.jpg"></h2>

- Gather website scored well in all areas on desktop. The Quick View functionality, which uses anchor links without a href caused the SEO score to be lower than desired. 

# Browser Compatibility

The site was tested in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox on desktop.

The site was tested in Google Chrome and Safari on mobile and tablet.

No issues arose during browser testing.

# Responsiveness

Responsivity tests were carried out using Google Chrome DevTools. Device screen sizes covered include:
- iPhone SE
- iPhone XR
- iPhone 12 Pro
- Pixel 5
- Samsung Galaxy S8+
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- iPad Mini
- iPad Air
- Surface Pro 7
- Surface Duo
- Galaxy Fold
- Samsung Galaxy A51/71
- Nest Hub
- Nest Hub Max

I also personally tested the website on iPhone 11, iPad Pro 2nd Generation, Dell XPS 15 laptop and a Dell widescreen monitor.

# Automated Testing

- Please note I only added Automated Testing at the end of the project. Not all features are tested. See more in my Future Features section.

## Python Tests

- I have set up a test to check the is_admin function. This functiona allows for multiple user names to be given admin permissions.

- I have set up a test to check that format_string_to_list function. This function formats user input into arrays for storing in MongoDB

- I have only tested functions that do not require a mock database.

## Javascript Tests

- I have created a test to check the turnArrayIntoString function. This function takes the array from MongoDB, and uses Javascript to present it as a string on the page.

# Peer Review

- In the final stages of the project, I submitted the site for Peer Review by fellow students and alumni at Code Institute via Slack.

- Feedback was positive on the appearance of the website. On a suggestion I updated the three-across section on the landing page to make it look better on iPad. It was also suggested I could increase the margin on the view recipe page on iPad. I took it into consideration but I decided not to do this.

- Peer testing demonstrated that I had overlooked testing some possible situations relating to favouriting and deleting recipes. These included:
    - If a user favourites a user's recipe, and then that user deletes the recipe
    - If a user favourites a recipe with a specific cuisine ID, and then that cuisine is deleted by admin.

- Peer review also pointed out an unresolved bug I had relating to the module.export method used by Jest JavaScript testing. I was able to find a resolution for this on Stack Overflow (see code credits).

# Bugs

- To Complete

## Resolved

- Heroku Postgres Database issue: I experienced an issue when I tried to change my Favourites model. At this point my database was already deplyed to Heroku. Looking on Slack and speaking to fellow CI students, it seemed likely that I could resolve my problem by resetting my database and creating my models again. I did this and it resolved the issue.

- Exsisting Cuisine Bug: Upon testing, I realised that users could still add duplicate cuisines. Upon reviewing the code, I realised that, because I had followed the username logic, I was only searching the database for lower case matches. I removed the .lower() method and this fixed the bug. This does mean however that admin users could add duplicate cuisines with different capitalisations. Further validation to the form could prevent.

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/error-thrown-from-duplicate-cuisine.jpg"></h2>

- Google Chrome Console error caused by Jest: The module.export method used by Jest JavaScript tesing was causing an error to appear in Google Chrome Developer Tools. I found a fix for this on Stack Overflow (see code credits).

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/console-log-module-error-test.jpg"></h2>

- Favourites not being removed upon deletion: Errors were being thrown if a user's favourite recipe was deleted, either by another user or my an admin deleting a cuisine, and cascade deleting the recipe. I added logic to the code to ensure favourites were being removed at the same time as recipes and cuisines were being deleted.

<h2 align="center"><img src="gather/static/testing/images/internal-error.png"></h2>

## Unresolved

- Admin Permissions on Nav Bar using an if/elif statement: Within Python, I am using the is_admin function to allow me to give mutliple usernames admin permissions. However I have not been able to reflect this logic in the Jinja templating I am using for the nav bar. As a solution, I have used an if/else statement. However this would need to be updated everytime a new user is granted admin permissions.

- 404 from Cuisine Functions: Upon testing my website, I realised that entering an invalid URL (such as entering a space) into some pages caused errors which were not handled by my Try/ Except clauses. I noticied that the pages being affected are generated by functions which relate to my Postgres data base. With these I am using a get_or_404 method. I assume this is causing this bug, but I need to do further testing to confirm.
